<h2>Basic information</h2>
        <p>
            Katy Perry, real name <strong>Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson</strong>, was born on <strong>25 October 1984</strong> in Santa Barbara,
            California. She chose her mother's maiden name, Perry, as her stage name. She has got two siblings. Younger
            brother David Hudson and older sister Angela Hudson.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her both parents were pastors, so they had to move frequently due to their parents' reassignments to different
            churches around the country. By the time Katy was 11, they had settled back in Santa Barbara. During this time,
            her parents had occasional financial problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Young Katy listened primarily to <strong>gospel music</strong>,
            as she had no chance at all to get into any other genre in her religious family. Later, through her friends, she
            discovered the magic of <strong>pop music</strong>. She started recording cassettes and singing songs to her parents who saw
            talent in her. From the age of 9 she took singing lessons and by the age of 17 she was singing in the church
            where her parents worked. On her 13th birthday, she got a guitar and started performing publicly with songs she
            wrote herself. Outside that, she enjoyed <strong>rollerblading</strong>, <strong>skateboarding</strong>, <strong>surfing</strong> the waves of the Pacific Ocean and
            took <strong>dance lessons</strong>.

<h3>Her unusual hobby</h3>
        <p>
            Katy Perry likes to play with her hair, but you probably didn't know that the singer is into collecting other celebrities' hair. She even spoke openly about it at a fan meet and greet, admitting that she keeps Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift locks in her purse. "It's totally creepy but amazing," she said.

<h2>The beginnings of a promising career</h2>
        <p>
            Katy Perry was literally passionate about music, as evidenced by the fact that she completed her
            <strong>GED</strong> (General Educational Development) requirements as a freshman in high school and left Santa
            Barbara's Dos Pueblos High School at 15 to pursue music full-time. She also briefly studied Italian opera at the
            Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. Katy's talent was noticed by artists <strong>Steve Thomas</strong>
            and <strong>Jennifer Knapp</strong> of Nashville, Tennessee. They took Katy under their wing and began to
            further develop her talent. In Nashville, she began recording her first demos and playing guitar. She released
            her first studio album, <strong>Katy Hudson</strong>, on March 6, 2001 under the auspices of Red Hill Records.
            The album was in the gospel style and was positively received by critics, but was commercially unsuccessful with
            200 units sold. After this album, <strong>she quit gospel music</strong> and began working with producer <strong>Glen
            Ballard</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            She moved to Los Angeles at the age of 17 and briefly performed as <strong>Katheryn Perry</strong> in 2003 to avoid confusion
            with famous actress Kate Hudson. She later began using the stage name <strong>Katy Perry</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perry's song <strong>"Simple"</strong> appeared on the soundtrack to the 2005 film <strong>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</strong>
            (directed by Ken Kwapis). She also collaborated on the song <strong>"Old Habits Die Hard"</strong> by <strong>Mick Jagger</strong>, frontman of
            the legendary <strong>Rolling Stones</strong>, which was featured on the soundtrack of the romantic comedy <strong>Alfie</strong> (dir. Charles
            Shyer, 2004). The song won the award for <strong>Best Original Song</strong> at <strong>the 62nd Golden Globe Awards</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2008, Katy Perry participated in the <strong>Warped tour</strong>, a rock festival touring the US and Canada, held every
            summer since 1995. In November 2008, she was given the role of <strong>presenter</strong> at <strong>the MTV Europe Music Awards</strong>, from
            which Perry herself took home <strong>the Best New Act award</strong>. She then won the <strong>International Female Solo Artist award</strong> at
        <strong>the Brit Awards</strong> in February 2009, beating out such stars as <strong>Beyonc√©</strong> and <strong>Pink</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            She launched her <strong>first concert tour</strong> to celebrate the release of <strong>One of the Boys</strong> on 23 January 2009 in Seattle,
            USA. During the tour she toured almost the entire world, performing in North America, Asia, Oceania and Europe.
            Czech
            audiences, however, could not see Katy on home soil, so they had to go to Germany, or to the very last concert
            of this tour, which took place in our Austrian neighbours on 28 November 2009.
