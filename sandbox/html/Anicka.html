    <td><strong>One of the Boys</strong>  <br> (2008)</td>
    <td>Novelty or not? That was the question people asked of Katy Perry during her breakthrough. “I Kissed A Girl” is the sort of song that, while almost guaranteed to be a sure-fire smash, might also overshadow an artist who had plenty more to offer. The new-wave-influenced co-write (with hitmakers Max Martin, Cathy Dennis, and Katy’s producer, Dr. Luke) seduced the international charts with consummate ease, topping Billboard’s US Hot 100 listings and scaling similar peaks in key markets such as the UK and Germany. But we all know how tough following such a monster debut can be… And as the lead single for Katy’s second studio album, One Of The Boys, it was a controversial springboard for the star.</td>

    <td><strong>PRISM</strong> <br> (2013)</td>
    <td>Prism is the fourth studio album by American singer Katy Perry. It was released by Capitol Records on October 18, 2013. While the album was initially planned to be "darker" than her previous material, Prism ultimately became a prominently dance-inspired record. Perry worked with several past collaborators, while enlisting new producers and guest vocals. Much of Prism revolves around the themes of living in the present, relationships, and self-empowerment. The album garnered generally positive reviews with critics praising its lyrics for being more "mature" and personal, while others considered Prism to be more formulaic than her previous material.</td>
